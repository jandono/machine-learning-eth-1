Description
We first split the image into gray and white matter using a MatLab plugin (SPM + VBM). During that same process the plugin is capable of voxel normalization so in the end we get voxel values between 0 and 2. Afterwards when we are loading the data, we cut out the outer black voxels, such that they we end up with a cube containing the brain only.

Afterwards we use SelectKBest with f_classif as a score function to select the best K features. K was chosen using cross validation. We select the features for each of the three following classifiers individually and also vary the number of features for each of them (gender: 10000, age: 4000, health status: 500).

As a model we used three individual Support Vector Classifiers. For predicting the gender we used a linear kernel, while for the other two classifiers (age and health status) we used a radial basis function kernel. The model for each classifier was selected using 10-fold cross validation

No post processing was performed.

IMPORTANT NOTE: 
The GM extraction takes about 20 minutes per .nii image and the resulting images are 11GB in size. That is why we pickled the selected features and put the pickled files into source. The original code can be found commented in predict_final.py.
